1) C++ has multiple ways to pass parameters while Java just has pass-by-value.
2) C++ doesn't require classes to write a simplistic program.
3) C++ has struct, unions, classes, and arrays to offer simplistic data structures while Java only 
	has arrays and classes.
4) C++ has preprocessor directives, and the closest thing that Java has is imports which doesn't 
	offer anyother functionality.
5) C++ applies encapsulation for a list of functions and variables all at once while Java requires
	encapsulation to be set for every variable and method.
6, 7, 8) Mozilla, MySQL, and JVM are written in C++ for optimal performance and flexibility.
